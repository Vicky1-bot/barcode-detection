# barcode-detection:

## Real-time barcode detection in video with Python and OpenCV
  Our barcode detection in video system can be broken into two components:

  A module that handles detecting barcodes in images (or in this case, frames of a video) Luckily, We’ll just clean the code up a bit and reformat it to our purposes.
  A driver program that obtains access to a video feed and runs the barcode detection module.
  
  Here’s an example screenshot from the video stream:
